### setup

Use nvm to install the correct version of node. Once installed you can just do `nvm install` to ensure the correct version is installed and then `nvm use`

You need to install redis locally, then follow the steps to launch it on startup (on the default port of 6379). For OSX/MacOS:

```shell
brew install redis
```

Arch Linux:

```shell
pacman -S redis
systemctl enable redis.service
systemctl start redis.service
```

Ubuntu Linux:

```shell
sudo apt-get -y install redis-server
sudo systemctl enable redis
sudo systemctl start redis
```

Next install the node modules (and Yarn, if you don't already have it available):

```shell
npm install -g foreman yarn
yarn install
```

Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying .env.example. Values below are team specific and should be supplied as needed:

```
ADMIN_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=[ client id ]
ADMIN_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=[ client secret ]
AWS_S3_BUCKET=[ bucket name ]
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=[ secret access key ]
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=[ access key id ]
COOKIE_NAME=[ any string without spaces ]
COOKIE_SECRET=[ any string without spaces ]
EMAIL_SENDER=[ email ]
FACEBOOK_APP_ID=[ app id ]
FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET=[ app secret ]
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=[ client id ]
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=[ client secret ]
HYLO_ADMINS=[ your user id ]
JWT_SECRET=[a string without spaces]
LINKEDIN_API_KEY=[ api key ]
LINKEDIN_API_SECRET=[ api secret ]
MAILGUN_DOMAIN=[ domain ]
MAILGUN_EMAIL_SALT=[ salt ]
MAPBOX_TOKEN=[ key ]
PLAY_APP_SECRET=[ app secret ]
ROLLBAR_SERVER_TOKEN=[ token ]
SEGMENT_KEY=[ key ]
SENDWITHUS_KEY=[ key ]
SLACK_APP_CLIENT_ID=[ client id ]
SLACK_APP_CLIENT_SECRET=[ client secret ]
UPLOADER_HOST=[ hostname ]
UPLOADER_PATH_PREFIX=[ path ]
```
* `ADMIN_GOOGLE_CLIENT_*`: To access the admin console.  Get these values from the [hylo-admin Google project](https://console.developers.google.com/project/hylo-admin).
* `DEBUG_SQL`: set to `true` if you want to output the SQL used within knex/bookshelf
* `DATABASE_URL`: set to your local DB instance
* `PLAY_APP_SECRET`: set to a string over length 16 to avoid the code erroring. real value only needed for running in production environment
* `ROLLBAR_SERVER_TOKEN`: use the `post_server_item` token in  [Rollbar](https://rollbar.com/hylo_dev/Hylo/settings/access_tokens/)
* `SENDWITHUS_KEY`: set up a test key in SendWithUs to send all email only to you (ask someone with admin rights to set this up)
* `SLACK_APP_CLIENT_ID`: set up an app on Slack and reference its' client id, optional for dev installation
* `SLACK_APP_CLIENT_SECRET`: reference the client secret from that same app on Slack, optional for dev installation

### populating the database

Make sure you have Postgres running with PostGIS installed and your user has create database privileges, then you should be able to:

```shell
createdb hylo -h localhost
createdb hylo_test -h localhost
cat migrations/schema.sql | psql hylo
yarn knex seed:run
```
This is only necessary if you're creating a fresh instance and aren't going to be loading a database snapshot (see below for that process). If you're new, you can also use the dummy seed to truncate everything and populate a bunch of fake data including a test account login like so:

```shell
NODE_ENV=dummy yarn knex seed:run
```

*This will trash everything in your current `hylo` database, so make sure you really want to do that!* The script will ask for confirmation. By default the test user will be `test@hylo.com` with password `hylo`, configurable at the top of `seeds/dummy/dummy.js`.

If you are working with farm group data, run this command to add fake farm data to either a database copy, or a db copy generated by the seeding function. This function is *not* designed to be run more than once successfully.

```shell
NODE_ENV=farmdev yarn knex seed:run
```

### running the dev server

```shell
yarn dev
```

This reads the `.env` file you created above, using [dotenv](http://www.npmjs.org/package/dotenv), and starts two processes managed by `foreman`: one web server process and one background job worker process, as listed in `Procfile.dev`. If you want to run only one of the processes, pass its name in `Procfile.dev` as an argument, e.g. `yarn dev -- web`.

Now visit [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

### developing locally with SSL (for testing iFrame embedding)

Create a local certificate and make sure your computer trusts it.
Here are some up to date instructions for macOS: https://deliciousbrains.com/ssl-certificate-authority-for-local-https-development/

Create a directory `config/ssl` and copy the .crt, key and .pem (CA certificate) files to it. Assuming the names are localhost.crt, localhost.key and localhost.pem then add a file at `config/local.js` with the contents:

```
var fs = require('fs')
var path = require('path')

module.exports = {

  /**** Setup an SSL certificate for local development with SSL (so we can test iFrame embedding) ***/
  ssl: process.env.PROTOCOL === 'https' ? {
    ca: fs.readFileSync(path.resolve(__dirname, './ssl/localhost.pem')),
    key: fs.readFileSync(path.resolve(__dirname, './ssl/localhost.key')),
    cert: fs.readFileSync(path.resolve(__dirname, './ssl/localhost.crt'))
  } : false

}
```

Change your `.env` file to have:
```
PROTOCOL=https
```

### Setting up to handle auth with JWTs and become an OpenID Connect provider
- Run `yarn generate-rsa-key-base64`
- Copy generated base64 string to .env file: `OIDC_KEYS=base64key`
- You can add multiple keys by separating them with a comma (to rotate keys in the future)

### running tests

Run `yarn test` or `yarn cover`. The tests should use a different database (see below), because it creates and drops the database schema on each run.

Create a file called `.env.test` to set environment variables for the test environment.

```
# NOTE: don't put comments after a variable initialization.  it will break your tests!

# run tests against a different database
DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost/hylo_test
DOMAIN=testdomain
# this prevents jobs that were queued during testing from being run in development
KUE_NAMESPACE=qtest
PROTOCOL=http
# don't log errors to Rollbar
ROLLBAR_SERVER_TOKEN=
# you can set up a SendWithUs API key to return valid responses but send no email
SENDWITHUS_KEY=test_...
MAILGUN_EMAIL_SALT=FFFFAAAA123456789
MAILGUN_DOMAIN=mg.hylo.com
PLAY_APP_SECRET=quxgrault12345678
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=foo
UPLOADER_PATH_PREFIX=foo
```

(Without the above Mailgun values, you'll see a failing test in the suite.) Since the test database was created above, `npm test` should work at this point.

### creating and running database migrations

Migrations are managed by the [knex](http://knexjs.org) library. Create a new migration with this command:

```shell
knex migrate:make my_migration_name
```

(You can either install knex globally with `npm install -g knex`, or run the version in your `node_modules` with `./node_modules/.bin/knex`.)

Run migrations with `npm run migrate` and rollback the last one with `npm run rollback`.

### loading database snapshots

The values of `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, and `DB_NAME` below can be obtained from `DATABASE_URL` in `heroku config`.

```shell
LOCAL_DB_NAME=hylo
DUMP_FILENAME=dbdump
pg_dump -O -U $DB_USERNAME -h $DB_HOST -p $DB_PORT $DB_NAME > $DUMP_FILENAME
# stop all processes that have open database connections, then:
dropdb $LOCAL_DB_NAME -h localhost
createdb $LOCAL_DB_NAME -h localhost
cat $DUMP_FILENAME | psql -h localhost $LOCAL_DB_NAME
```

### Design guidelines

* GET methods on `FooController` should return instances of `Foo`. (See policies.js for some related FIXME's)

### Style guidelines

We're gradually migrating to [Javascript Standard Style](https://github.com/feross/standard).
The [standard-formatter Atom package](https://atom.io/packages/standard-formatter) helps out a lot.
The [linter-js-standard](https://atom.io/packages/linter-js-standard) package is also very helpful.

## GraphQL API

Our main API uses GraphQL. You can browse the queries and mutations by going to http://localhost:3001/noo/graphql and using the Documentation Explorer in the right sidebar.

Example Queries:

```
type Query {
  me: Me
  person(id: ID): Person
  ...
}
```

where `Me` is the currently logged-in user. For example, to load all current user's posts:

```
{
  me {
    posts {
      id,
      title,
      type,
      details,
      creator {
        id,
        name,
        avatarUrl
      }
      followers {
        id,
        name,
        avatarUrl
      }
      followersTotal,
      groups {
        id,
        name
      },
      groupsTotal,
      comments {
        id,
        createdAt,
        text,
        creator {
          id
        }
      },
      commentsTotal,
      createdAt,
      fulfilledAt
    }
  }
}
```
