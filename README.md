### hi!

Thanks for checking out our code. The documentation below may be incomplete or incorrect. We welcome pull requests! But we're a very small team, so we can't guarantee timely responses.

:heart:, [Edward](https://github.com/edwardwest), [Ray](https://github.com/razorman8669), [Lawrence](https://github.com/levity), [Minda](https://github.com/Minda), & [Robbie](https://github.com/robbiecarlton)

### setup

You need to install redis locally, then follow the steps to launch it on startup:
```shell
brew install redis
```

next install the node modules
```shell
npm install -g forever sails foreman
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the root of the working copy, with contents like this:
```
ADMIN_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=foo
ADMIN_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=foo
ASSET_HOST_URL=http://localhost:1337
BUNDLE_VERSION=dev
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/hylo
DEBUG_SQL=false
DOMAIN=localhost:3001
EMAIL_SENDER=dev+localtester@hylo.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=foo
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=foo
FACEBOOK_APP_ID=foo
FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET=foo
KISS_AUTH_TOKEN=foo
KISS_AUTH_COMMUNITY_ID=9
LINKEDIN_API_KEY=foo
LINKEDIN_API_SECRET=foo
MAILGUN_DOMAIN=mg.hylo.com
MAILGUN_EMAIL_SALT=FX988194AD22EE636
NODE_ENV=development
PLAY_APP_SECRET=foo
PRETTY_JSON=true
PROTOCOL=http
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
ROLLBAR_SERVER_TOKEN=foo
SEGMENT_KEY=foo
SENDWITHUS_KEY=foo
HYLO_SLACK_ICON=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Connoropolous/hylo-image/master/hylo48.png
```
* `ADMIN_GOOGLE_CLIENT_*`: To access the admin console.  Get these values from the [hylo-admin Google project](https://console.developers.google.com/project/hylo-admin).
* `ASSET_HOST_URL`: The host for static assets. In development, this is the [hylo-frontend](https://github.com/Hylozoic/hylo-frontend) server, which listens at `localhost:1337` by default.
* `DEBUG_SQL`: set to `true` if you want to output the SQL used within knex/bookshelf
* `DATABASE_URL`: set to your local DB instance
* `PLAY_APP_SECRET`: set to a string over length 16 to avoid the code erroring. real value only needed for running in production environment
* `ROLLBAR_SERVER_TOKEN`: use the `post_server_item` token in  [Rollbar](https://rollbar.com/hylo_dev/Hylo/settings/access_tokens/)
* `SENDWITHUS_KEY`: set up a test key in SendWithUs to send all email only to you (ask someone with admin rights to set this up)
* `HYLO_SLACK_ICON`: should be a 48x48 pixel icon optimized for display within slack

### running the dev server

```shell
npm run dev
```

This reads the `.env` file you created above, using [dotenv](http://www.npmjs.org/package/dotenv), and starts two processes managed by `foreman`: one web server process and one background job worker process, as listed in `Procfile.dev`.

Now visit [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

### creating and running database migrations

Migrations are managed by the [knex](http://knexjs.org) library. Create a new migration with this command:

```shell
knex migrate:make my_migration_name
```

(You can either install knex globally with `npm install -g knex`, or run the version in your `node_modules` with `./node_modules/.bin/knex`.)

Run migrations with `npm run migrate` and rollback the last one with `npm run rollback`.

### initializing the database schema

This is only necessary if you aren't going to be loading a database snapshot. If you just want to set up a fresh instance, with nothing in the database, you have to run
```shell
cat migrations/schema.sql | psql [your-database-name]
```

### loading database snapshots

The values of `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, and `DB_NAME` below can be obtained from `DATABASE_URL` in `heroku config`.

```shell
LOCAL_DB_NAME=hylo
DUMP_FILENAME=dbdump
pg_dump -O -U $DB_USERNAME -h $DB_HOST -p $DB_PORT $DB_NAME > $DUMP_FILENAME
# stop all processes that have open database connections, then:
dropdb $LOCAL_DB_NAME -h localhost
createdb $LOCAL_DB_NAME -h localhost
cat $DUMP_FILENAME | psql -h localhost $LOCAL_DB_NAME
```

### design guidelines

* GET methods on `FooController` should return instances of `Foo`. (See policies.js for some related FIXME's)

### style guidelines

We're gradually migrating to [Javascript Standard Style](https://github.com/feross/standard).

The [standard-formatter Atom package](https://atom.io/packages/standard-formatter) helps out a lot. We deviate from its default behavior only in not indenting a multi-line method chain:

```javascript
# yes
return Do(() => {
  amaze()
  very()
})
.then(such)
.tap(wow)

# no
return Do(() => {
  amaze()
  very()
})
  .then(such)
  .tap(wow)
```

The [linter-js-standard](https://atom.io/packages/linter-js-standard) package is also very helpful.
