## [5.1.0] - 2022-12-21

### Added

- Bug that prevented saving group settings sometimes

## [5.0.2] - 2022-11-13

### Added
- New allow_in_public flag on groups that determines whether the group appears in the Group Explorer and whether posts from that group are allowed in the public stream. This flag is turned off for new groups by default while we figure out our strategy for deciding whether it should be on or off for any given group.
- Every new group has a #general topic added to it as a default topic. This will be more important/useful when topic based chat rooms are released soon!

### Fixed
- Update `hylo-shared` to fix bug in Mention HTMl generation
- Autolinking (links being turned into clickable links) in Group descriptions is turned back on
- Can set group settings when creating a group via API. This fixes an issue where the group's locationDisplayPrecision was not being set correctly.

## [5.0.1] - 2022-10-24

### Fixed
- Update `hylo-shared` to fix bug in Mention HTMl generation

## [5.0.0] - 2022-10-24

### Added
- `Post#LinkPreviewFeatured` to indicate if a `LinkPreview` should be given precedence in the UI when displaying post
- All parsing of `Post#details` and `Comment#text` HTML is now handled here and nowhere else, moving and refactoring `presentHTML` from `hylo-shared` to support new TipTap editor formatting, and consolidating similar functions from `hylo-evo` all and here all into `RichText`
- Support for Post "Collections" which are a curated set of posts. New `collections` and `collections_posts` tables.
- CustomViews can now be of type 'collection' and point to a collection_id. When this is the case the Collection name will always be the same as the CustomView.
- CustomViews can now have a default sort specified.
- Much better inline documentation of our GraphQL APIs using Graphiql or other graphql doc viewers.

### Changed
- Updates `LinkPreview` scrapping to be more rich and somewhat more reliable
- Updates all notification email and push notifications to work with new `RichText` handling, fixing/improving some results
- Deprecates use of `linkifyjs` for `autolinker` for link recognition in HTML, and `cheerio` for `jsdom` for parsing
- Replace 'express-graphql' library with 'graphql-yoga'. Back-end errors are now returned to the front-end with generic text of 'Unknown Error', except when explicitly specified in the back-end by throwing a GraphQLYogaError object.
