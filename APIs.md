# Authenticated APIs

We have recently launched our MVP of APIs to be used by partners. Currently you have to contact us at hello@hylo.com if you want access to the APIs. We will give you an API key and secret manually.

# API calls

### Authenticate
Before making any API calls you must get an auth token

`POST to https://hylo.com/noo/oauth/token`

__Headers:__
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

__Parameters (all required):__
- grant_type = client_credentials
- resource = the server URL you are making the call to (e.g. https://hylo.com, https://staging.hylo.com, or https://localhost:3000)
- scope = api:write
- client_id =  YOUR_ID
- client_secret = YOUR_SECRET

This call will return an Auth Token for use in later API calls. This token will expire in 2 hours at which point you will need to make another API call to get a new Auth Token (AUTH_TOKEN).

For every subsequent API you will need to authorize by passing this token as Bearer Token in the Authorization Header:
`Authorization: Bearer AUTH_TOKEN`

### Create a User

`POST to https://hylo.com/noo/user`

__Headers:__
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

__Parameters:__
- name (required) = Judy Mangrove
- email (required) = email@email.com
- groupId (optional) = the id of a group to add the user to
- isModerator (optional) = true to add the user to the group specified by groupId as a moderator

__Return value__:

On success this will return a JSON object that looks like:
```
{
    "id": "44692",
    "name": "Judy Mangrove",
    "email": "email@email.com"
}
```

If there is already a user with this email but they are a not member of the group, this call will send them an invitation to join the group. You will receive:
`{ message: "User already exists, invite sent to group GROUP_NAME" }`

If there is already a user with this email and they are already a member of the group:
`{ message: "User already exists, and is already a member of this group" }`

If there is already a user with this email and you didn't pass in a group you will receive:
`{ message: "User already exists" }`

### Create a Group

`POST to https://hylo.com/noo/graphql`

__Headers:__
Content-Type: application/json

This is a GraphQL based endpoint so you will want the pass in a raw POST data
Example GraphQL mutation:
```

      "moderatorDescriptorPlural": "Stewards", // Default is Moderators
      "settings": {
        locationDisplayPrecision: precise, //   precise => precise location displayed, near => location text shows nearby town/city and coordinate shifted, region => location not shown on map at all and location text shows nearby city/region
        publicMemberDirectory: false, // Boolean
      },
      "type": <valid type or empty for default group type>,
      "typeDescriptor": "Ranch", // Group is the default
      "typeDescriptorPlural": "Ranches" // Groups is the default
